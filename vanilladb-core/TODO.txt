# TODO

## Server package
- Check if we need refactoring profiler-related methods in VanillaDB.

## File package
- FileMgr should not know the position of the database and log directory.
- FileMgr should not rebuild log files itself, it should provide a API for creating and deleting files.
- FileMgr dosen't actually write a block to file during appending for now. This is a bug that should be fixed.
